<p>I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. <a href='https://www.gaohuang.net/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Gao Huang</a>.
I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2022, and during my undergraduate years, I also studied Electrical Engineering.
Previously, I interned at Sea AI Lab Singapore for over a year, working under the guidance of Prof. <a href='https://yanshuicheng.info/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Shuicheng Yan</a> and collaborating closely with <a href='https://bingykang.github.io/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Bingyi Kang</a>.</p>
<p>My research primarily focuses on developing AI generalist decision-making systems. My interests include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="color: #4CAF50; background-color: #E8F5E9; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;">Reinforcement Learning</span> for skill acquisition and self-improvement</li>
    <li><span style="color: #4CAF50; background-color: #E8F5E9; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;">Multimodal LLMs</span> for generalized perception and advanced reasoning</li>
    <li><span style="color: #4CAF50; background-color: #E8F5E9; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;">World Models</span> for planning and scalable data generation</li>
    <li><span style="color: #4CAF50; background-color: #E8F5E9; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;">Embodied AI</span> for real-world interactions and applications</li>
